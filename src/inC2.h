// InC2 plays two roles. First, it's a factory for InC2Comm objects. Second, it lets us keep track of MPI initialization and finalization
// Forcing it into a class means the user never needs to worry about MPI if they aren't using it elsewhere.
// Other methods should probably be kept out of this class to keep loose coupling, but factory methods belong here
// In the future, we might want to allow other communication methods beyond MPI.
